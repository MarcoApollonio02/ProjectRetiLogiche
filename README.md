## Request and Explanation

We were asked to implement a digital logic project for the course "Progetto di Reti Logiche" course. The main objective was to design, simulate, and verify a combinational/sequential circuit based on the provided specifications.

For more details, see the [`Request`](./Request) folder in this repository.

## Components

- **VHDL/Verilog Source Files:** All code for the digital circuit.
- **Testbenches:** Scripts and files used to verify the correct behavior of the circuit.
- **Simulation Results:** Output waveforms and analysis.
- **Report:** Summary of the project, challenges faced, and solutions.

## Deliveries
- Source code files (`.vhd`/`.v`).
- Project report containing a detailed explanation of all the components that we created, how they interact with each other to resolve the problem that was posed to us, and different test bench to verify the correctness of our implementation
